## Overview
- The Vitamin-D Calculator is a digital healthcare tool designed to provide accurate, personalized vitamin D supplementation recommendations for healthcare providers and patients. This calculator addresses critical gaps in vitamin D prescription accuracy, digital integration, and patient monitoring across Germany and Austria.

### Problem Statement
Healthcare providers currently face multiple challenges in vitamin D supplementation management:

- Digital Vitamin-D Prescription Problem: Healthcare providers lack a standardized digital system for prescribing vitamin D supplements, leading to inconsistent dosing recommendations and poor integration with electronic health records.

- Accuracy of Calculation Problem: Current vitamin D dosage calculations are prone to human error and lack standardized algorithms that account for patient-specific factors such as body weight, baseline vitamin D levels, and absorption rates.

- Tracking Record Problem: There is no comprehensive system to monitor patient compliance with vitamin D supplementation regimens or track changes in vitamin D status over time, making it difficult to assess treatment effectiveness.

- Accessibility of Prescription Problem: Patients face barriers in accessing vitamin D prescriptions due to limited healthcare provider availability, geographic constraints, and lack of user-friendly platforms for prescription management and refills.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
